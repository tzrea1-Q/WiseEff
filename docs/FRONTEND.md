# Frontend

WiseEff frontend is a Vite, React, TypeScript SPA. It currently supports a rich mock-backed prototype plus M0 seams for API mode.

## Key Directories

- `src/app/`: page routing, navigation, permission checks.
- `src/domain/`: role, parameter, log, debugging, audit, and Agent domain types and pure logic.
- `src/application/ports/`: frontend-facing business interfaces.
- `src/infrastructure/mock/`: mock state and mock implementations for demos/tests.
- `src/infrastructure/http/`: API client, DTOs, auth client, runtime mode.
- `src/components/`: reusable UI, layout, tables, dialogs, filters, charts.
- `src/features/agent/`: unified Agent UI.
- `src/test/setup.ts`: Vitest DOM setup.

## Runtime Modes

Default mode is `mock`, which supports demos and frontend development.

API mode:

```text
VITE_WISEEFF_RUNTIME_MODE=api
VITE_WISEEFF_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787
```

Production builds must not use mock runtime as a business data source.

## Frontend Rules

- Keep business rules out of page components when they can live in `domain/` or a focused view-model file.
- Keep API DTO mapping in `infrastructure/http/`.
- Do not let UI permission checks become the security boundary; backend writes must enforce permissions.
- Preserve mock mode when adding API mode unless the task explicitly removes a prototype path.
- Prefer existing component patterns and tests before adding new primitives.

## Testing

Use targeted tests while editing:

```bash
npm test -- src/path/to/test.tsx
```

Use broader checks before finishing frontend-impacting changes:

```bash
npm test
npm run build
```

Testing priorities:

- Role and permission visibility.
- Workbench filters, sorting, table states, and dialogs.
- Agent actions and confirmation behavior.
- Runtime mode parsing and API error mapping.
- Domain pure functions and DTO conversions.
