# WiseEff API Contract Design

## Principles

WiseEff uses REST + JSON under the `/api/v1` prefix. The frontend talks to the backend through application ports and HTTP DTO mapping rather than page-owned fetch logic.

Rules:

- All writes require authentication, authorization, validation, audit, and idempotency where practical.
- List endpoints support pagination, sorting, and filtering.
- Errors use a structured envelope with request IDs.
- Long-running work exposes job status or event streams.
- OpenAPI contract freshness is checked in CI.

## Endpoint Groups

- Auth and users: `/me`, user listing, user creation, activation, role replacement.
- Projects and modules: project metadata and module lookup.
- Parameters: parameter listing, detail, history, drafts, submission rounds, change requests, imports.
- Logs: upload/file records, analysis records, runs, rerun, archive, feedback.
- Jobs: status and progress events.
- Debugging: devices, target detection, sessions, node reads/writes, snapshots, rollback.
- Agent: sessions, messages, tool runs, approvals, rejection.
- Audit: audit event listing and detail.
- Operations: liveness, readiness, metrics, pilot/release readiness.

## Governance

The backend remains the contract owner. Frontend DTOs must map explicitly and tests must fail on drift. New endpoints should be added to the OpenAPI artifact and reviewed for authz, audit, error envelope, pagination, and evidence impact.

Run:

```bash
npm run contract:check
```
